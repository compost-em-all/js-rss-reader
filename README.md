### :book: JS RSS Reader ###

A simple, barebones RSS reader written in ES6 JavaScript.

No accounts, no social media integration... or really much of anything.

In an effort to learn more about JS, especially ES6, I wanted to create something I can use - I end up more invested in building things for either myself or others vs foo bar baz tutorials.

Being as how most RSS readers these days require an account, I wanted to build an RSS reader that I can use on my local machine, with no account, and still check out all the sites I like reading in one place.

NOTE: This is a personal project where I am building something for myself to use so code will likely be a little messy as I learn more and add features to this project as I think of them. If you like what you see, feel free to fork/clone. I don't anticipate anyone submitting PRs but you can do that as well if you feel so inclined and I'll check them out/merge them.
