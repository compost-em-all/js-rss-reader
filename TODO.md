### Todo / Ideas ###

* Basic CRUD functionality vs having to manually edit a JSON file
  - checking inputs to make sure they are valid

* Check JSON file when getting URL/Title pairs to make sure improperly formatted values are ignored

* Some CSS to liven everything up a little :nail_care:

* Mark things as read

* LocalStorage for persistent data
  - only re-render for a site if what was retreived is different than what is already stored

* Configurable automated refresh period
  - configurable notifications (just a badge with number of new items)

* Find a reliable way to work with CORS that is not a browser addon
  - Needs to work with Fetch API
